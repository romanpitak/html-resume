                description: |
                    I analyzed, designed and developed the back end of web applications. Although they were mostly based on the Nette
                    framework with MySQL, I also developed an e-shop in Magneto and collaborated on projects in Symfony 2 with the
                    Kunstmaan CMS.

                    I regularly directly communicated with clients on projects specifics during the analysis phases.

                    I designed and executed the migration process and cleanup of over 2000 emails to a new email marketing provider.

                    While coding HTML newsletter emails, I created a “meta language” in PHP based on an HTML object model that
                    allowed me to effortlessly create content and locale variations of the emails. That, paired with the dotMailer API
                    client library I wrote, cut the estimated email deployment times by 80%.

            I was responsible for running and maintaining an e-Billing application spread over multiple servers. The application
            core was an Oracle database running on an HP-UX machine. Data (PDF, XML) preprocessing and loading was
            controlled by about four hundred shell scripts and binaries. Final data population was provided by 16 MS Win 2005
            servers with ASP. My duties included: shell script editing and development, log analysis (UNIX, DB), installation of
            patches and releases (UNIX, WIN), performance tuning (UNIX) and administration of 9 MS Win 2005 servers with
            ASP.

            I also volunteered and created a web application providing incident tracking for our project. This application is
            based on PHP 5.3 with the Nette framework, MySQL and jQuery.
