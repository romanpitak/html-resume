                    I~implemented a~distributed data collection service using the~AWS~infrastructure.
                    The~servers are written in Literate~CoffeeScript and~the~data is stored in a~NoSQL database.
                    I~also maintained and~altered running projects in~PHP.

                    I~analyzed, designed and~developed the~back~end of web~applications.
                    They were mostly based on the~Nette~framework with MySQL,
                    but I~also developed an~e-shop in~Magneto and~collaborated on projects in Symfony~2 with the~Kunstmaan~CMS.

                    I~regularly directly communicated with clients on projects specifics during the~analysis phases.

                    I~designed and~executed the~migration process and~cleanup of over 2000 emails to a~new email marketing provider.

                    While coding HTML newsletter emails, I~created a~“meta language” in~PHP based on the~HTML object~model.
                    This~allowed me to effortlessly create content and~locale variations of the~emails.
                    That, paired with the~dotMailer~API client library I~wrote, cut the~estimated email deployment times by~80%.
